# Homework-12

## There is a schema / seeds file to use to test this program under ./db

### Challenge #1: Customer View (Minimum Requirement)

1. Everything works in this bit.
2. Cool features include Columnify npm, inquirer validation, ability to add quantity instead of just 'updating stock' which required calling external functions.
3. Option to continue or quit is a simple function which I could copy over to my other files
3. Challenges : Async issues when trying to nest the updateqty and productsales functions inside the larger function.

### Challenge #2: Manager View (Next Level)

1. Everything works
2. addinv function does pretty crazy stuff between adding object arrays to inquirer choices, Add inventory feature is very cool and gave me tonnes of async / validation / sql issues
3. addnew was relatively simple even if it was a long query

### Challenge #3: Supervisor View (Final Level)

1. Everything works
2. The query for the *View Product Sales by Department* feature was annoying to figure out since I had to keep making changes to the database to test it. I did learn how to quickly make changes to a database for testing right on workbench which was pretty cool
